## Features

- **Motor Control**: Fine-tuned motor angle adjustments, directional movement, and complete rotations.
- **Navigation**: Zone detection, pedestrian interactions, and real-time adjustments using sensors.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Integrated touch, color, and ultrasonic sensors for dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- **Testing Utilities**: Modular scripts for individual feature testing and debugging.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brick-robotics-scripts.git
   ```

2. Ensure MATLAB and the Brick framework are installed.

3. Update the IP address in the scripts to match your LEGO EV3 Wi-Fi configuration:
   ```matlab
   brick = Brick('ioType', 'wifi', 'wfAddr', '127.0.0.1', 'wfPort', 5555, 'wfSN', '0016533dbaf5');
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Navigate to the relevant script folder:
   ```bash
   cd Brick\ Robotics\ Control\ Scripts/Motor\ Control/
   ```

2. Open the desired script in MATLAB and run it:
   ```matlab
   Brick_MotorAngleRel_Test
   ```

3. Review robot behavior and make adjustments as needed.
